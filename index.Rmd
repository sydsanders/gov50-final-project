## Project thoughts

I have not decided what I want to do my final project on yet, so these thoughts are subject to change. However, I might be interested in analyzing the efficacy of Cambridge housing policy for the homeless. I am a volunteer Supervisor at the Harvard Square Homeless Shelter, and we use a data platform called the Homelessness Information Management System (HMIS). There is a ton of data in here about the experiences with homelessness of all the houseless in Cambridge who access services, as well as housing placement efficacy data. I want to analyze how effective different policies are at helping alleviate homelessness, both temporarily and in the long term. I would also probably use the national government's yearly homelessness reports, which are informed in Massachusetts by the HMIS system.
